title: Quantum Blockchains Mining a Relevant Work
description: |
---
At QuantumHack, we envision a future in which human interaction is not only transparent, fast, and accountable, but also secure, efficient and environmentally friendly. Blockchains, thought as distributed ledgers, allow for the first. However, they present several drawbacks, such as the high energy consumption dedicated to “dumb mining” and most notably the security risks posed by the advent of quantum computers. Quantum based Blockchains have the potential to be fully secure and utilize the computing resources used for mining to do relevant work.
