We are a group of people in a superposition state of several topics: quantum information -
                  engineering - programming - hacking â€¦ anything else. We consider it crucial to exploit machine learning
                resources to understand quantum systems and at the same time use quantum information theoretical
                results to improve machine learning algorithms.
                   We understand the relevance of such tools
                for building a scientific network, which can allow not only for individual achievements,
                but (more importantly) also for an overall progress in Quantum Information. We are willing to
                contribute to this goal by sharing technical computational tools and scientific input,
             such as ideas for new experimental setups in quantum optics and
             experimental data for collaborative analysis.
