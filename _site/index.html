In the video’s description is a link to the source code for the simulation Toronto computer hardware company Xanadu is working on advanced AI and “photonic quantum computing” chips to enable quantum applications of machine learning For some excellent visuals and explanations of various neural network architectures, see the articles “The Neural Network Zoo Prequel Cells and Layers” and “The Neural Network Zoo” by AI research company The Asimov Institute. You can also read Andrew Tchircoff’s “The mostly complete chart of Neural Networks, explained” at Towards Data Science Some neural networks can be run inside phone applications and are bundled in a file with special extensions (e.g., .mlmodel for apps running MLModel on the iPhone or .tflite for apps running TensorFlow Lite on Android devices). So, by example, iPhone developers can integrate machine learning models into their apps by using Apple’s Core ML framework, the Core ML API, and the MLModel class. The key point is that some neural networks work with the limited resources of a CPU on something like an iPhone, which is amazing, and perhaps a stepping stone to neural networks running on even lower-power IoT devices in the future. Amazon AWS Machine Learning currently supports three types of machine learning models, namely binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression, each of which is ideal for making different types of predictions Game theory; complexity theory; statistics of many kinds, as well as major statistical theories (e.g., Bayesian) and related techniques (e.g., regression); linear algebra, and other academic disciplines appear to be important layers to the work of artificial intelligence. That is very interesting, something machine learning technologies appear to share with decentralized systems (blockchains) to work, they must draw on principles from economics, statistics, computer science, and mathematics Some universities offer not only free online courses but also paid certificate programs, such as MIT Online’s professional education and Stanford Online’s graduate education, in various sub-areas of machine learning For a short technical introduction to prior distributions, likelihood functions, & posterior probabilities in the software Stata, see Chuck Huber’s video “Introduction to Bayesian statistics, part 1 The basic concepts” The MIT Sloan Management Review article “The Machine Learning Race Is Really a Data Race” by Megan Beck and Barry Libert raises good questions about the importance of unique data to train machine learning models used in commercial applications Tools Amazon Machine Learning Azure Machine Learning Studio Caffe & Caffe2 Colaboratory DataCamp Google Cloud AI & Machine Learning PyTorch TensorFlow Supplemental Notes on Tools Colaboratory, a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud, has a lot to love, but in particular comes with an interactive notebook version of Jake VanderPlas’s book, Python Data Science Handbook Essential Tools for Working with Data, and links to the self-paced website, Machine Learning Crash Course by Google Google Cloud Platform has excellent self-paced material in its Google Cloud Training Platform, which includes labs through Qwiklabs and three Data and Machine Learning learning tracks one for data analysts, one for data engineering, and one for data scientists For one opinion on PyTorch vs TensorFlow, see “Tensorflow or PyTorch  The force is strong with which one?” by Yashwardhan Jain Quantum Machine Learning bridges the gap between abstract developments in quantum computing and the applied research on machine learning. Paring down the complexity of the disciplines involved, it focuses on providing a synthesis that explains the most important machine learning algorithms in a quantum framework. Theoretical advances in quantum computing are hard to follow for computer scientists, and sometimes even for researchers involved in the field. The lack of a step-by-step guide hampers the broader understanding of this emergent interdisciplinary body of research. Quantum Machine Learning sets the scene for a deeper understanding of the subject for readers of different backgrounds. The author has carefully constructed a clear comparison of classical learning algorithms and their quantum counterparts, thus making differences in computational complexity and learning performance apparent. This book synthesizes of a broad array of research into a manageable and concise presentation, with practical examples and applications. Bridges the gap between abstract developments in quantum computing with the applied research on machine learning Provides the theoretical minimum of machine learning, quantum mechanics, and quantum computing Gives step-by-step guidance to a broader understanding of this emergent interdisciplinary body of research You can edit this line in _config.yml.

              <br/>
                <p> Welcome to Quantum Hack Machine Learning</p>
                <p>We are a group of people in a superposition state of several topics: quantum information -
                  engineering - programming - hacking … anything else. We consider it crucial to exploit machine learning
                resources to understand quantum systems and at the same time use quantum information theoretical
                results to improve machine learning algorithms.
                   We understand the relevance of such tools
                for building a scientific network, which can allow not only for individual achievements,
                but (more importantly) also for an overall progress in Quantum Information. We are willing to
                contribute to this goal by sharing technical computational tools and scientific input,
             such as ideas for new experimental setups in quantum optics and
             experimental data for collaborative analysis.
